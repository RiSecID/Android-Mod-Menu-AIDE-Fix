# Android Mod Menu AIDE fix

**UPDATE: AIDE is now supported on the main project. Please read [README-MOBILE.md](https://github.com/LGLTeam/Android-Mod-Menu/blob/master/README-MOBILE.md) to get started!**

This project is a temporary fix for AIDE app for Android for those who don't have a PC

Thanks to MITOS Team. Watch his video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1uwckMQkxQ

I personally don't use AIDE so i can't confirm if it works or not. This may not work for someone

If it does not work, try other fix by [Raunak Mods](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCti3Xie4fKiqPW49ARfDzgw): https://github.com/LGLTeam/Android-Mod-Menu-AIDE-Fix/tree/RaunakMods-fix
